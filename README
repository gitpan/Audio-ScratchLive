The following Perl module is to facilitate crate and database management with
the Scratch LIVE application from Serato.  http://www.scratchlive.net

Note - This module is in no way official from Rane/Serato.  There are bound to
be some issues, so please make a backup of all crates and databases before
attempting anything with this module.

There is a functioning Java application called ScratchTools to aid with crate
management as well.  http://www.scratchtools.de

HISTORY

I am a DJ as well as a programmer.  I use Scratch LIVE now as it has become
ubiquitous in the DJ circle.  I have noticed that maintaining crates can get
quite cumbersome, especially when you have multiple thousands of tracks to deal
with.  Hell, just try to change the location of a track!

For that reason, this module was born.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

    - To use the module afterwards, you'll need to do this:
        use Audio::ScratchLive;

INSTALLATION - alternate

To install this module to a different path:

   perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/path/to/some/dir
   make
   make test
   make install

    - To use the module afterwards, you'll need to to this:
        use lib '/path/to/some/dir';
        use Audio::ScratchLive;

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  Carp
  File::Spec
  File::Slurp

WHAT WORKS

Reading crate and database information.

WHAT DOESN'T WORK (a.k.a. TO DO)

* Figuring out exactly what all of the unknown fields are.
* Some more crate reading stuff.
* Being able to write altered crate and DB files.
